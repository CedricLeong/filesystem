filesystem
==========
  The file system has been able to initialize but many of the operations we still need to implement.
These operations are as follows:
    1.Creating a file
    2.Opening a file
    3.Closing a file
    4.Writing to a file
    5.Reading from a file
    6.Deletling a file
    
In addition to the operations we need to implement, along the way we will need to implement things such as the index block and the free block list. 
Not only ar ethey neccessary for these operations but to fully initialize the filesystem we will need these objects. Other then that were close to being done.
